# Automatic rubiks cube solver
Scrambeling makes 30 random turns and solving restores it to its original shape with the roux method. Cube is also turnable with keys L R U D F B M E S X Y Z, see [Cube notation](https://jperm.net/3x3/moves).
Test it out at [Rubiks](https://madebydamo.github.io/rubiks/)!

The meet and bone of this project is in the package [rubiks_core](./rubiks_core), where the basic model, solving automation tools and everything else is stored. [rubiks_web](./rubiks_web) is just the presentation layer of this project.
